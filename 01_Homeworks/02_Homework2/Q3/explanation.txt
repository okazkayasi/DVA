Q3.a.2. Rating vs Wins&Noms seems to be better at seperating linearly. Bad ratings gather together at the left-bottom side, whereas good ratings are collected at top parts.

Q3.c. Log scale can be used when there are some super large numebers in dataset comparing others. The chart won't lose the details of the majority.
      Square root scale can be used at less extreme cases. It will bring numbers closer, but not as much as log scale do.
