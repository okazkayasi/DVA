1. Ease to develop
    
	Seaborn: Easier than D3 but less flexible. 
        Tableau: Can be done without any introduction.
        D3     : Steep learning curve for me. Super flexible.

2. Easy to maintain the visualization

	Seaborn: Need to run again with new dataset.
        Tableau: Need to run again with new dataset.
        D3     : No need to run again.

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users

	Seaborn: Doesn't have interactivity. Good for most cases
	Tableau: Good for presentations.
	D3     : Interactivity adds a lot, visually. I think most can be done w/o interactivity, too.

4. Scalability of visualization to large dataset

	Seaborn: Python is great with large datasets. So, Seaborn will do fine.
	Tableau: Can be integrated with Amazon AWS, MySQL, Hadoop etc. So, it is awesome.
	D3     : Since SVG DOM elements uses too much RAM, it won't work really well.

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users

	Seaborn: Any system that runs Python will work.
	Tableau: Doesn't work on Linux.
	D3     : Uses web browsers. It will work on any system that supports web.
