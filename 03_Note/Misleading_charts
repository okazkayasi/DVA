1 - Misleading Bar Charts

    - Bar chart vertical axis starts with 0
    - Disorienting color bars is wrong.
      - Color bars of a group should be colored using gradation
    - Avoid Tilted or Rotated labels.
      - Try horizontal layout. Don't settle for the default.
      - Label can be under bars and numbers on the left when horizontal
    - Line charts 
      - Axis labels are far by 2 or 5 or 10.
      - Special care how we design the vertical range.
      - y-axis doesn't need to start with 0.
      - Aim for two-third of the range is filled with data.
    - Multiple Patterned Lines in one chart
      - Common is assigning different marks (dotted - circle etc.)
      - People prefer to see more continuity.
      - You can use color instead or line-thickness.
      - Thickness and color (brigtness works too) can show the continuity.
      - Sometimes you have a lot of lines use "SMALL MULTIPLE" by E.Tufte.
    - Tables:
      - Do not use everything bold or italic.
      - If everything is special, nothing is special.
    - Chart junk
      - Low "data to ink ratio" by Edward Tufte
      - Put a grid line one out of 4 lines to make it easier to read.
    - Pie Charts
      - Use them rarely. If given pie chart what to do. 
      - Tilted pie chart (2.5 D) SUCKS!
      - When tilted it gives the false illusion.
    - Log scale instead of linear scale:
      - Include numbers from different orders of magnitude.
      - Compress wide range of data.
      - 1 to 1 Billion example. 
      - log-scale works good for time
      - Compress 1-2-3 months then 1 year 2 year 4 year 30 years.

2 - Applying What You've Learned

    - No crossing labels. Instead use horizontal.
    - Do not use white over black
    - Do not use over emphasise or over bold the text.
    - Table stuff as done is HW2 Q1.

3 - Practitioners' Guide
 
    - Colors: 
      - Start with b&w, then add colors carefully.
      - This forces you to focus on content and layout
    - Fonts :
      - sans-serif is generally easier to read.
    - Animation> 
      - Start with no animation, then add meaningful ones.
    - Use pictures and videos
       - Pictuires are more succint & memorable.
       - When you have good stuff, put them when people are 
         still awake.
    - For every project "CUT TO THE CHASE" image.
    - For researchers: 
      - People tend to skim and look at interesting things.
      - Have a crown jewel image.
      - Use your most impressive figures, even similar to 
        another
    - Figures should be self-contained. 
    - People shouldn't go back and forth between text & 
      figures.
    - Figure should succintly desrive your main (take-away) 
      message. It can be given at Figure explanation line.
    - For printed materials, print them and check.
    - For presentation, about 7 lines of text on a slide.
